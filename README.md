## Inspiration
The need for comfortable and healthy indoor spaces is essential, not only for people but also for indoor plants. Our goal was to create an easy way to monitor temperature and humidity, helping people optimize their environment and support plant health.

## Project overview
Our project features a sensor that tracks both temperature and humidity levels in real-time. The sensor is connected to a microcontroller, which transmits the collected data to AWS for storage and further analysis.
